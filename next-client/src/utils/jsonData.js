1/2 cup of milk (whole, almond, oat, or any milk of your choice)
1-2 tablespoons of sugar or sweetener (adjust to taste)
1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)
Ice cubes
Whipped cream (optional for topping)
Chocolate syrup or caramel sauce (optional for drizzling)`,
    instructions: `Brew the Coffee:

Start by brewing your favorite coffee. You can use a traditional drip coffee maker, a French press, or even cold brew if you prefer.
Sweeten the Coffee:

While the coffee is still hot, stir in the sugar or sweetener until fully dissolved. If you're using cold brew, you can dissolve the sugar in a small amount of hot water first before mixing it in.
Add Vanilla (Optional):

For an extra layer of flavor, add a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and stir it into the sweetened coffee`
